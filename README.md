## Introduction
### About Viterbi 
Viterbi is a Canberra-based AI upskilling and recruiting platform. We connect graduates and early career professionals to ventures that need AI talent. We are also working to create upskilling and reskilling opportunities for professionals to transition into AI.

### About this project
The objective of this project is to develop a series of Natural Language Processing applications that will utilize the latest LLM (Large Language Models) APIs. The objective of our project is to develop a resume and cover letter builder that uses generative algorithms (think GPT-3, bloom, and other generative models) to create well-crafted resumes and cover letters. Additionally, there are conversational bots that act as interviewers to assist in preparing for interviews. This research was conducted to provide students such as yourself with the capability of constructing perfectly tailored resumes and cover letters in accordance with a job description and company, and to develop an AI coaching system to assist students in preparing for technical interviews in English. Interpersonal Skills training could expand into a wide range of fields.

## Risk Assessment

| Risks     | Potential Costs    | Mitigation  |
| :-------------- |:----------------:| :----------------------------------------:|
| Team        | Extra uncertainty project outcomes  | Enhance team cooperation and communication, and try to avoid team member turnover.  |
| Organizational Environment       | Impact project performance  | Stabilize the organization environment, and get informed of changing organizational support in advance.   |
| Requirements        | Time and resources for useless system | Continue to communicate with clients, and get correct, clear, adequate and usable requirements.      |
| Planning and Control    | unrealistic schedules/budget, excessive schedule pressure  |  Make accurate duration estimates, and analyze what resources to commit to the corresponding development effort.    |
| User        | Project failure   | Investigate the specific user's preferences, make the appropriate UI, and keep communication with them.     |
| Project Complexity   | Impact on project performance  | Determine whether new technology is used, implement automaticity, and interact with external entities.    |
| Accuracy of classification and retrieved articles | Cannot achieve what the client anticipate (100% accuracy) | Optimize the machine learning model as much as possible. Solve the problem indirectly by ranking  |
